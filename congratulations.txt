In ancient times, when kings did reign, And magic was a common thing, There was a word of power and fame, That could describe both land and ring.

It could be used for realms and sites, For functions and for names. It could be used for scopes and rights, For concepts and for games.

This word was sought by many a mage, And guarded by the wise. It could unlock the secrets of the age, And open hidden eyes.

What is this word, so old and plain, That holds such mystery and lore?
